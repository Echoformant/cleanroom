# Codex Trials Workspace

This directory is a protected experimental environment for Codex-driven iterations.
All files here are non-production and exist only within the `codex-experimental` branch.

## Rules
- Codex may freely create, modify, or delete files in this directory.
- No files here should be merged into `main`.
- No CI/CD pipelines should run on this directory.
- This workspace is for prototypes, drafts, and experimental logic only.

## Purpose
Provide a safe, isolated environment for Codex to:
- generate pipeline prototypes
- test YAML fragments
- draft scripts
- explore ideas without affecting production
