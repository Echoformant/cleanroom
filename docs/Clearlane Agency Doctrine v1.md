## **Clearlane Agency Doctrine v1**

**Status:** Draft  
 **Applies to:** Operation NAMI Clearlane (Arkansas)  
 **Objective Class:** Structural agency through full-spectrum visibility  
 **Assumption Policy:** Zero assumptions · Authority-only · No inference

---

### **I. Purpose**

The **Clearlane Agency Doctrine** establishes a formal operating framework that enables **NAMI Arkansas to exercise agency** within Arkansas’s multi-authority environment by maintaining **360-degree visibility** across all relevant jurisdictional and administrative lanes.

The doctrine exists to **prevent inadvertent authority capture** while enabling **intentional, lawful, and effective engagement** that produces durable change.

---

### **II. Operating Premise (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Authority is latent.**  
    It often activates through secondary and tertiary instruments, not statutes alone.

2. **Money carries authority.**  
    Funding paths transmit control conditions downstream.

3. **Desks are switches.**  
    Administrative touchpoints can activate committees, policies, and delegated powers.

4. **Language triggers governance.**  
    Definitions, labels, and schema alignment can silently import authority.

5. **Intent is irrelevant.**  
    Capture occurs by structure, not motive.

---

### **III. Definition of Agency (Canonical)**

**Agency is the ability to choose, engage, design, and act with foresight before authority attaches.**

Agency requires **visibility first**, action second.

---

### **IV. Jurisdictional & Administrative Awareness Model**

#### **Jurisdictional Lanes (Source of Power)**

* Legislative

* Executive

* Judicial

#### **Administrative Lanes (Operational Surfaces)**

* AOC

* DHS

* ADH

These lanes **do not align cleanly**. Authority propagates **between** them through funding, delegation, and administrative instruments.

Clearlane requires continuous awareness **within our lane and across all others**.

---

### **V. Threat Model: Capture Mechanisms**

Clearlane explicitly guards against capture via:

* Delegated or undefined statutory terms

* Administrative committee activation

* Internal policy manuals and guidance

* Reporting and data schemas

* Eligibility framing and population language

* Certification or credential recognition

* Pass-through funding conditions

* Advisory or consultative participation

* Cross-agency incorporation by reference

Any single mechanism may activate authority independently.

---

### **VI. Visibility Requirements (360° Standard)**

For **any** funding, program, partnership, or artifact:

1. **Upstream visibility**

   * Source statute

   * Appropriation language

   * Delegation authority

2. **Lateral visibility**

   * Adjacent agencies

   * Parallel programs

   * Committee jurisdictions

3. **Downstream visibility**

   * Reporting obligations

   * Audits

   * Reclassification risk

   * Future eligibility hooks

No action proceeds with partial visibility.

---

### **VII. Decision Gates (Hard Controls)**

Every action must pass these gates:

1. **Authority Gate**

   * Is the controlling authority explicit and bounded?

2. **Desk Gate**

   * Which agency desk(s) will this touch?

3. **Language Gate**

   * Does any term inherit external definitions?

4. **Committee Gate**

   * Does this trigger review, oversight, or advisory bodies?

5. **Future-State Gate**

   * Could this activate authority later even if inert now?

If **any answer is unclear** → action is paused and mapped.

---

### **VIII. Engagement Rules**

* Engage **AOC directly**, with boundary enforcement

* Observe **ADH carefully**, model joint authority risk

* Continuously map **DHS**, even when not engaged

* Never accept funds or language that obscure authority origin

* Never rely on “custom,” “practice,” or “assurance” absent citation

---

### **IX. Documentation Doctrine**

* All artifacts are **append-only**

* All authority references are **explicit**

* All uncertainties are **flagged, not resolved by assumption**

* All exits are **documented before entry**

Documentation is not clerical — it is **protective infrastructure**.

---

### **X. Exit Rules (Critical)**

Clearlane requires **predefined exits**:

* If authority scope expands beyond mapped bounds

* If reporting schemas import external control

* If committees assert oversight without clear authority

* If funding conditions change post-award

Exit is an exercise of agency, not failure.

---

### **XI. Canonical Doctrine Statement**

**Clearlane exists to give NAMI Arkansas the structural sight required to act intentionally in a system designed to govern by implication.**  
 **Visibility creates choice.**  
 **Choice enables agency.**  
 **Agency enables change.**

---

### **XII. Version Control**

* **Doctrine:** Clearlane Agency Doctrine

* **Version:** v1 (Draft)

* **Status:** Pending formal adoption

* **Amendment Rule:** Append-only; no silent revisions
