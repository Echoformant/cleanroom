What’s inside:

* **Nodes** sheet \= divisions, offices, programs, committees, systems, document hubs  
* **Edges** sheet \= “from → to” control links (administers, certifies, advises, pays, distributes funds, sets standards)  
* **Edge Families** sheet \= the categories of edges you must inventory (authority gates, Medicaid payment gate, certification gate, committee governance, etc.)  
* **Seed Evidence** sheet \= starter entries aligned to your `evidence_item` schema fields  
* **Backlog** sheet \= tonight’s P1 research items (what to pull next)

This workbook format fits your schema-governed approach (dossier \+ schemas \+ governance), but the graph itself can live as a working map while you “artifactize” the critical edges.

## **What counts as a DHS “edge”**

An **edge** is any mechanism that gives DHS **control**, **delay**, **veto**, **definition power**, or **choke-point leverage**.

### **DHS-touch triggers (automatic RED)**

If any of these are true, it’s DHS-touched:

1. **Administering body** is DHS (office/division/program)  
2. **Intermediary / pass-through** is DHS (subgranting, reallocations)  
3. **Certification / credential gate** requires DHS approval  
4. **Committee governance** is formally tied to DHS or advises DHS on standards  
5. **Medicaid authority / operations** sit in DHS Medicaid apparatus  
6. **Provider enrollment, billing, or reimbursement** is controlled through DHS systems  
7. **Policy manuals / standards** are DHS-issued or DHS-approved  
8. **Procurement / contracting authority** is DHS  
9. **Data/reporting systems** required for participation are DHS-controlled  
10. **County/regional operations** require DHS eligibility or processing

Your own internal note already frames the practical consequence: SAMHSA-type dollars become “state-controlled gravity,” not thrust, when they route through DHS.

## **Seed DHS lane edges already mapped (high-confidence)**

These are **hard, documentable DHS control surfaces** (already seeded in the workbook).

### **A) OSAMH \= grant/admin control surface**

* **OSAMH is inside DHS** and is positioned as an oversight/grants hub for prevention/treatment/recovery programs.  
* The **About OSAMH** description explicitly signals grant distribution functions (federal grant distribution language appears in the OSAMH materials).

### **B) Peer system \= DHS certification \+ governance surface**

* **Peer Training and Certification** is structured so peer workers are certified via a **DHS-approved accrediting entity** — that is a hard DHS gate.  
* The **Arkansas Peer Advisory Committee (APAC)** is explicitly positioned as a resource to **DHS/OSAMH** on peer matters — committee governance is part of the lane.  
* APAC has a **regional structure** documented in DHS-hosted materials (regional representation requirements are published in DHS-hosted PDFs).  
* DHS hosts a **peer documents hub** (applications, APAC docs, ethics, training docs) — this is a standards/operations choke point.  
* DHS-hosted standards docs for peer/family/youth support include DHS approval language (training/requirements tied back to DHS).

### **C) Medicaid \= DHS payment \+ eligibility surface**

* The **Division of Medical Services (DMS)** is a DHS division and explicitly manages day-to-day Arkansas Medicaid operations, including provider payment.  
* CMS lists **Arkansas DHS as the State Medical Assistance Office** contact for Medicaid — useful as a clean authority anchor for “Medicaid \= DHS touch.”  
* DHS county operations pages describe Medicaid/health care program eligibility operations — this is part of the distributed “lane” footprint.

### **D) “Who do we talk to?” (decision-owner surfaces)**

You don’t need every employee to map the lane; you need **decision-owner roles \+ rosters**.

* OSAMH maintains contact/staff pathways publicly (use as roster source, not personal targeting).

## **How you expand this into “every edge” fast**

Use the workbook as the “graph backbone” and expand in layers:

### **Layer 1 (Tonight / before the meeting): choke points only**

Populate edges for:

* **Certification gate**  
* **Medicaid payment/billing gate**  
* **Grant pass-through**  
* **Committee governance**  
* **Standards/manuals**

This gets you 80% of DHS interference surfaces.

### **Layer 2 (Next 72 hours): regional footprint \+ contracting**

Add nodes/edges for:

* County/regional offices involved in eligibility, referrals, enrollment  
* Behavioral health contractors/subrecipients  
* Procurement/RFP channels and monitoring/audit requirements

### **Layer 3 (Next 2 weeks): statutory mapping (“all the laws” without boiling the ocean)**

You do **not** map “all behavioral health laws.” You map **laws that create DHS control edges**:

* Medicaid state plan / SPAs / provider manuals that condition peer/BH services  
* DHS enabling statutes for OSAMH \+ DMS and delegated authorities  
* Any statutes that define peer service roles or reimbursement gates  
* Any statutes that define who administers behavioral health funds

## **What you walk into the meeting with tomorrow**

1. **The workbook graph** (nodes \+ edges) showing DHS as a *lane*  
2. A short readout: **Top DHS choke points** (peer certification \+ Medicaid \+ OSAMH grants \+ committee governance) with citations  
3. A rule that ends arguments fast:  
   **“If an edge touches DHS control surfaces, it’s RED. We do not negotiate RED.”**

---

If you paste any additional notes or links you already have (especially anything naming programs, committees, portals, manuals, or contracts), I will **slot them into Nodes/Edges**, assign **edge family \+ disposition**, and generate the **P1 research pulls** that close remaining gaps for tomorrow.
