# Operation NAMI Clearlane — Charter (v1)

## Purpose
Operation NAMI Clearlane is a law-anchored operating framework designed to enable
NAMI Arkansas to act intentionally, defensibly, and transparently within its
external legal, funding, and institutional environment.

Clearlane clarifies boundaries, authority, and routing conditions so decisions
are made with full jurisdictional awareness.

## What Clearlane Is
- A navigation framework for authority, funding, and control
- A boundary-clarification method operating within VECTOR 1
- A dossier-governed system relying on schema-validated artifacts
- A decision-support structure, not a decision-maker

## What Clearlane Is Not
- A funding strategy
- A compliance opinion
- A risk scoring model
- An advocacy position
- A narrative report

## Governing Rules
All Clearlane outputs must:
- Be traceable to schema-validated artifacts
- Preserve separation between authority, evidence, money flow, and field posture
- Explicitly log absence of evidence where applicable
- Avoid inference, speculation, or intent attribution

## Decision Authority
Clearlane does not make decisions.
Clearlane produces visibility.
Decisions are made by NAMI Arkansas leadership using Clearlane outputs as evidence-anchored inputs.

## Status
This document is a living charter.
