## Mapping Hidden Authority Layers

### Purpose

This section defines **how Operation NAMI Clearlane is used in practice to surface hidden, latent, or indirect authority** without speculation, assumption, or premature operationalization.

Clearlane is **not yet an output system** at this stage of work. It functions as a **detection instrument** — a lens used to observe how authority *could* activate before it does.

The goal is **agency through visibility**, not compliance through reaction.

---

## Operating Principle

> **Hidden authority almost always enters through funding, not mission.**

Authority propagates through secondary and tertiary instruments that sit beneath statutes and above enforcement. Clearlane is designed to detect those propagation paths **before engagement**, not after capture.

---

## Step 1 — Start From Money, Not Programs

**Method**

- Select **one funding source**:
  - appropriation
  - grant
  - federal or state pass-through
- Freeze scope.
- Do **not** interpret intent, purpose, or program design.
- Treat money as a **carrier of latent authority**.

**Key Question**

> *Where can this money legally and administratively travel?*

This immediately constrains the universe of analysis.

---

## Step 2 — Trace the Funding Path Vertically (Jurisdiction First)

Before agencies are considered, jurisdiction must be resolved.

**Map the following, in order:**

- Statute authorizing the funds
- Appropriation language
- Special language or budget riders
- Delegation clauses (e.g., “as determined by,” “in consultation with”)

**What to look for:**

- Delegated discretion
- Undefined or cross-referenced terms
- Embedded consultation or approval requirements

These elements represent **authority injection points**.

---

## Step 3 — Trace Horizontally by Desk (Administrative Reality)

Apply the administrative overlay:

- Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)
- Department of Human Services (DHS)
- Department of Health (ADH)

For each possible desk the money can touch, ask:

- Does this desk administer?
- Does it review?
- Does it certify?
- Does it report?
- Does it merely “process”?

> **Key Rule:** If a desk can route, delay, condition, or interpret, it has authority gravity.

Even processing alone can activate committees or policies.

---

## Step 4 — Run the Latent Trigger Register (Scanner Mode)

Use the trigger register as a **scanner**, not a checklist.

For each desk or instrument, ask:

- Which trigger classes *could* activate here?
  - delegated terms
  - committee activation
  - reporting schema alignment
  - eligibility framing
  - incorporation by reference

You are **not proving activation**.

You are identifying **activation potential**.

That distinction is critical.

---

## Step 5 — Identify Secondary Instruments (The Hidden Layer)

This is where most frameworks stop. Clearlane does not.

Examine instruments *below* statutes and awards:

- Committee charters
- Internal agency policies
- Program manuals
- Reporting templates
- Portal requirements
- Renewal terms
- Historical practices

These instruments often:

- are not prominently published
- rely on vague statutory authority
- become binding through enforcement rather than rulemaking

This is the **labyrinth layer** of authority.

---

## Step 6 — Mark Authority Switches, Not Violations

Clearlane does **not** audit compliance.

It marks **conditional switches**:

- *If X happens, authority Y activates.*

Examples:

- If funds are routed through DHS finance, committee review may become mandatory.
- If population language mirrors Medicaid eligibility, DHS oversight may become arguable.
- If reporting schemas align to DHS fields, reclassification risk increases.

These are **conditional truths**, not accusations.

---

## Step 7 — Document Without Resolving

This step is non-negotiable.

Clearlane **does not collapse uncertainty**.

It:

- logs uncertainty
- flags latent triggers
- preserves ambiguity

It does **not**:

- normalize unclear authority
- interpret ambiguity away
- mitigate preemptively without evidence

> **Clearlane gains power by remembering uncertainty.**

---

## Step 8 — Build a Living Authority Map

Over time, as lanes are fact-checked, Clearlane accumulates:

- confirmed desk paths
- known committees
- observed trigger patterns
- verified exit points

Only **after** this accumulation do downstream artifacts become safe:

- intake checklists
- decision trees
- safe language lexicons

Clearlane grows **downward into evidence**, not outward into abstraction.

---

## Canonical Operational Rule

> **Clearlane maps where authority *could* activate — not where it already has.**  
> **That is what preserves agency.**

---

## What This Gives NAMI Immediately

Even before full lane mapping is complete, this approach provides:

- the ability to pause intelligently
- the ability to ask the right questions
- the ability to see risk before engagement
- the ability to choose timing and lanes deliberately

This is **agency in practice**, not later.

---

## Operational Note

When Clearlane resumes active mapping, the next move is **not to build artifacts**.

The next move is simply:

> **Name the first funding path to trace.**

Everything else is already in place.
