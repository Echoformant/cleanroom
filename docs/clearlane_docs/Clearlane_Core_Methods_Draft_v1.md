# Clearlane Guide  
## Core Methods for Artifact Discovery, Jurisdictional Navigation, and Capture Avoidance

## I. The Clearlane Artifact Hunt Method  
### How We Systematically Find What Matters

Clearlane does not rely on open-ended research or exploratory searching. Artifacts are discovered using a deliberate hunting method designed to ensure **360-degree visibility** across authority, implementation, and money.

The objective is not to “fill gaps,” but to walk the entire terrain so gaps reveal themselves naturally.

### A. The 360-Degree Visibility Model

Clearlane research operates with visibility in four directions:

- **Forward (What’s Ahead):** Anticipating downstream authority shifts, funding conditions, and control points before engagement.
- **Side-to-Side (Who Touches Whom):** Identifying agencies, partners, intermediaries, and advisory bodies interacting through money, approvals, or data.
- **Backward (Precedent and History):** Understanding prior structures, past reallocations, and legacy rules that constrain future action.
- **In-Between (Shifting Control):** Where authority migrates through MOUs, internal policies, advisory committees, formulas, or one-line clauses that can quietly reassign power.

This model prevents blind spots and protects future positioning.

### B. The Four Forced Paper-Trail Zones

Clearlane hunts artifacts only where paper must exist.

1. **Money Touchpoints** – If money moves, pauses, or exits, documentation exists.  
   Examples: appropriations, grants, match requirements, spending plans.

2. **Permission Gates** – If approval is required, documentation exists.  
   Examples: administrative orders, advisory approvals, sign-offs.

3. **Reporting Obligations** – If reporting is required, definitions and instructions exist.  
   Examples: grant reports, dashboards, audits.

4. **Constraint Surfaces** – If behavior is constrained, the constraint is written somewhere.  
   Examples: fee caps, eligibility limits, use restrictions.

## II. The Three-Lane Hunting Rule  
### Authority, Implementation, Money

Every domain is hunted using three lanes only.

### Lane 1: Authority Lane
**Question:** Who says this is allowed or required?

Includes statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and formal policies.

### Lane 2: Implementation Lane
**Question:** How is that authority actually exercised?

Includes advisory rules, formulas, internal policies, approvals, spending plans.

### Lane 3: Money Lane
**Question:** Where does money move, and under what conditions?

Includes appropriations, grants, pass-throughs, match rules, restrictions.

**Rule:** Complete lanes in order. Do not jump lanes.

## III. Arkansas Jurisdictional Lanes of Operation  
### AOC, DHS, ADH

These three lanes represent the first real administrative split below the Governor.

### A. AOC Lane — Judicial Administration
Controls specialty courts, accountability courts, court funds, and fees.  
Authority flows from the Arkansas Supreme Court.

### B. DHS Lane — Executive Social Services
Controls behavioral health systems, Medicaid, crisis services, grants.  
Highest capture risk due to internal policies and committees.

### C. ADH Lane — Public Health Administration
Controls public health programs, trauma system, licensing.  
Operates parallel to DHS.

### Canonical Rule

Courts operate through AOC.  
Services operate through DHS.  
Health operates through ADH.
