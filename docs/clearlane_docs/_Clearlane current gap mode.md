## **Current Mode**

* **Executive synthesis:** **NOT STARTED**

* **Permitted output:** **validated fragments only** (authority / money\_flow / field\_validation / evidence\_item)

* **Assembly behavior:** compile \+ cite \+ flag gaps; **no roll-up narrative**

## **Active Gap Register**

### **A. Oversight outcomes**

* **Compliance determinations/certifications:** **missing**

  * Target artifact types: award acceptance/terms letters, compliance attestations, certification notices (CMS/SAMHSA/DHS/ADH/AOC).

* **Enforcement actions:** **missing**

  * Target artifact types: NOVs, CAPs, suspension/clawback notices, formal corrective correspondence.

* **Audit coverage tied to FY2026 flows/appropriations:** **missing**

  * Target artifact types: FY2026-relevant audit reports/sections (Legislative Audit, Single Audit, OIG/internal).

### **B. Implementation layer**

* **Implementing instruments for specialty courts:** **missing**

  * Target artifact types: Administrative Orders (AO 14 / AO 18), AOC implementation manuals, plan approval forms, committee procedures.

* **Transaction/drawdown execution records:** **missing**

  * Target artifact types: drawdown schedules, payment vouchers, subaward registers, expenditure reports.

## **What We Do Next (Pipeline Validation Pass)**

For each new candidate document:

1. Extract into the correct schema artifact type.

2. Set **editor\_status: pending**.

3. Promote to **editor\_status: accepted** only after source/section alignment is verified.

4. Re-run the **fragment assembly** (no synthesis) to show which gaps moved from **open → partially closed → closed**.

If you want, I can also maintain a short **“Gap Closure Ledger”** inside each assembly run: gap name → accepted artifact IDs that close it → remaining missing artifact classes.
