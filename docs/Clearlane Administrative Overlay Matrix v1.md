## **Clearlane Administrative Overlay Matrix v1**

*(AOC / DHS / ADH × Trigger × Control Surface)*

**Status:** Draft · Operational  
**Applies to:** Operation NAMI Clearlane (Arkansas)  
**Method:** Authority-only · Zero inference · Append-only

---

### **Purpose**

Translate the **Latent Authority Trigger Register** into a **daily-use filter** that shows **where** and **how** authority activates across administrative lanes—and what Clearlane must do **before** activation.

---

### **Administrative Lanes (Operational Surfaces)**

* **Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)**  
* **Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS)**  
* **Arkansas Department of Health (ADH)**

## **Overlay Matrix**

| Trigger Vector | AOC (Judicial Admin) | DHS (Executive / Regulatory) | ADH (Executive / Public Health) | Clearlane Control Rule |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Desk Touch** | Low frequency; court-admin routing | **Primary activation point** | Occasional (grants admin) | Pre-route mapping required; avoid DHS desks |
| **Delegated Terms** | Rare; statute-bound | **Common; rule-defined** | Common via federal grants | Redefine or disclaim inheritance |
| **Committee Activation** | Court advisory bodies | **Standing internal committees** | Program councils | Demand statutory basis \+ scope |
| **Policy Manuals** | Court rules/admin orders | **Extensive internal manuals** | Program guidance | Prohibit incorporation by reference |
| **Reporting Schemas** | Case/program metrics | **Eligibility/compliance schemas** | Surveillance/grant schemas | Use Clearlane-native schemas only |
| **Eligibility Framing** | Program participation | **Medicaid & assistance eligibility** | Risk-factor framing | Education-only descriptors |
| **Certification Hooks** | Minimal | **Peer/provider certification** | Workforce/credential overlap | Explicit non-dependence |
| **Federal Pass-Throughs** | Limited | Common | **Common** | Trace full pass-through chain |
| **Advisory Participation** | Court councils | **Oversight-linked councils** | Health task forces | Observer-only; no governance |
| **Audit Scope** | Court audit bounds | **Scope expansion risk** | Grant compliance audits | Freeze scope at award |
| **Renewal Drift** | Re-appropriation | **Policy creep likely** | Conditional renewals | Full re-gate on renewal |
| **Language Import** | Court terminology | **High definitional gravity** | Mixed | Plain-language rewrite |
| **Data Sharing** | Case data | **Eligibility/compliance data** | Public health data | One-way, bounded sharing |
| **Enforcement Backplane** | Judicial authority | **Administrative enforcement** | Program enforcement | No enforcement delegation |

---

## **Risk Profile Summary**

| Lane | Capture Gravity | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **AOC** | **Low** | Single-branch alignment; no Medicaid/regulatory backplane |
| **DHS** | **High** | Regulator \+ funder \+ definitional authority |
| **ADH** | **Medium** | Executive admin; spillover when coupled |

---

## **Clearlane Gate Mapping (Operational)**

For **any** engagement touching a lane above:

1. **Desk Gate:** Which desk touches it—first and last?  
2. **Term Gate:** Do any words inherit external definitions?  
3. **Schema Gate:** Does reporting import control fields?  
4. **Committee Gate:** Is any review body activated?  
5. **Future-State Gate:** Can renewal or reporting reclassify us?

**Any unclear answer → pause \+ map.**

---

## **Use Instructions**

* Apply **before** proposal drafting, MOUs, submissions, renewals.  
* Log outcomes in append-only register.  
* Treat “custom/practice/assurance” as **non-authority**.

---

## **Canonical Lock**

**AOC is navigable.**  
**ADH is porous.**  
**DHS is gravitational.**  
**Clearlane sees all three.**
