Building the NAMI–AOC partnership charter  
Saved as chat  
Share your thoughts

Here’s a tight, ready‑to‑use **Living Charter** you can drop into your stack to formalize how **NAMI Arkansas** and the **Arkansas Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)** work together—covering scope, governance, reporting, and funding “handshakes” (who touches money, when, and how), with **explicit DHS avoidance** and DOJ/ADH lanes left open.

# **NAMI Arkansas × AOC — Living Partnership Charter (v1.0)**

**Purpose (why this exists)**  
Create a repeatable, compliant container for court‑adjacent, court‑referred, and community mental‑health programming led by NAMI Arkansas (education \+ peer support) in operational alignment with AOC—without funds flowing through DHS.

**Guiding Principles**

* **DHS‑free funding path** (primary), ADH/DOJ lanes allowed if non‑overlapping with DHS.  
* **Non‑clinical first**: NAMI programs are educational/peer‑led; clinical elements are opt‑in pilots with separate licensure and billing.  
* **Justice alignment**: Programs mapped to Sequential Intercept Model (SIM) where relevant.  
* **Evidence \+ accountability**: Clear reporting, auditable flows, minimal PHI.  
* **Modular & versioned**: Everything here is revisable via change control.

## **1\) Scope & Services**

### **1.1 In‑Scope (initial catalog)**

* **Education**: Family‑to‑Family, Peer‑to‑Peer, Basics, Ending the Silence, Connection/Family Support Groups (court‑referred, court‑adjacent, community).  
* **Court‑touchpoints**: Pre‑trial info sessions, compliance support workshops, reentry orientation, family navigation nights.  
* **Systems support**: SIM facilitation, stigma reduction, court staff mental‑health literacy training.  
* **Data‑light outcomes**: attendance, completion, satisfaction, simple goal attainment, referral uptake.

### **1.2 Out‑of‑Scope (unless separately authorized)**

* Clinical diagnosis/treatment; Medicaid billing; services requiring DHS accreditation; SUD‑only credential pipelines; custody of PHI beyond de‑identified aggregates.

### **1.3 Interfaces & Referrals**

* Warm handoffs to community providers; ADH collaborations permitted if no DHS flow‑through; DOJ‑funded pilots where eligible.

---

## **2\) Governance & Decision Rights**

### **2.1 Bodies & Cadence**

* **Steering Committee (SC)** — quarterly (or monthly during launch)  
  * Co‑Chairs: NAMI AR ED (or designee) \+ AOC Programs Lead  
  * Decides: strategy, portfolio adds/removes, funding lane selection, risk posture.  
* **Operations Workgroup (OW)** — bi‑weekly  
  * Leads: NAMI Program Director \+ AOC Court Liaison  
  * Runs: calendars, site onboarding, referral scripts, data collection, QA.  
* **Data & Compliance Huddle (DCH)** — monthly  
  * Reviews: reporting pack, privacy posture (HIPAA/CJIS/42 CFR Part 2 triggers), incident log.

### **2.2 RACI (high‑level)**

* **Program selection**: R (NAMI), A (SC), C (AOC), I (sites)  
* **Site onboarding**: R (OW), A (AOC court liaison), C (Judge/Clerk), I (SC)  
* **Funding applications**: R (NAMI grants), A (SC), C (AOC grants/compliance), I (OW)  
* **Data & reporting**: R (NAMI M\&E), A (DCH), C (AOC data), I (sites)  
* **Risk/compliance**: R (DCH), A (SC), C (Legal), I (OW)

## **3\) Reporting Model**

### **3.1 Standard Packet (monthly → roll‑up quarterly)**

* **Throughput**: \# sessions, \# participants (by program/site), completion.  
* **Access & equity**: county, rural/urban, age bands, language (de‑identified).  
* **Referrals**: inbound source (court, probation, defense, self), outbound handoffs.  
* **Outcomes (light)**: attendance %, completion %, participant self‑rated confidence/knowledge.  
* **Issues/Risks**: incidents, barriers, lessons learned, change requests.

### **3.2 Data Protection**

* Default **aggregate** reporting; participant identifiers not shared with AOC unless a **separately approved** legal basis exists.  
* Any PHI/PII handling requires a **Data Pathway Addendum** (DPA) and minimum‑necessary design.

---

## **4\) Funding “Handshakes” (DHS‑Avoidant)**

### **4.1 Allowed Lanes (examples)**

* **AOC‑administered** grants/contracts paid directly to NAMI AR.  
* **ADH‑aligned** grants **only if** no DHS pass‑through (verified in writing).  
* **DOJ/OJP/BJA/BJS/OVW** competitive grants (AOC lead or NAMI sub; or NAMI lead with AOC MOUs).  
* **Foundations/corporate** direct to NAMI AR; court letters of support as needed.  
* **Hospital/University/Coalition** pass‑throughs that do not route via DHS.

### **4.2 Prohibited**

* Any funding that **flows through DHS** or ties NAMI to DHS‑controlled credentialing or billing structures.

### **4.3 Flow Controls**

* **Funding Source Sheet** per award: prime, sub path, statutory authority, CFDA/Assistance Listing, match, allowability, flow‑through chain diagram, **DHS check \= “No”** gate.  
* **Segregated accounting** by award; standard allowability and time/effort rules; audit‑ready documentation.

---

## **5\) Legal, Privacy, and Risk**

* **Privacy stack**: HIPAA (if triggered), CJIS (if law enforcement data touches), 42 CFR Part 2 (if SUD info present)—default design is **to avoid triggering** by staying aggregate.  
* **Brand & fidelity**: NAMI national program standards maintained; any adaptation runs through SC and (if required) NAMI national guidance.  
* **Incident handling**: DCH owns intake; 72‑hour notification to SC for medium/high severity; corrective actions tracked in OW.  
* **Conflicts & ethics**: annual disclosures for key personnel; recusals recorded in minutes.

## **6\) Operational Playbooks (attachments referenced)**

* **A1. Court Referral Script** (one‑pager for judges, clerks, defenders, probation)  
* **A2. Site Onboarding Checklist** (room, schedule, accessibility, flyer approval, staff POC)  
* **A3. Data‑Light Sign‑In & Consent** (opt‑in contact, opt‑in follow‑up)

* **A5. Funding Source Sheet Template** (handshake checklist \+ DHS‑No gate)  
* **A6. SIM Mapping Quick Guide** (linking activities to Intercepts 0–5)  
* **A7. Risk Register** (likelihood/impact, owner, mitigation)

---

## **7\) Change Control (how the charter evolves)**

* **Minor** (templates, schedules): OW proposes → DCH notes impact → SC consent via email vote.  
* **Material** (new programs, data classes, funding lanes, jurisdictions): OW drafts → DCH review → SC approves in meeting; version bump (v1.x → v2.0).  
* Version log kept in the header of each artifact and the SC minutes.

---

## **8\) Term, Review, and Exit**

* **Effective date**: upon signature. **Term**: 24 months, auto‑renew yearly unless 60‑day notice.  
* **Quarterly** performance review; **Annual** comprehensive review (scope, funding, risks).  
* **Exit**: orderly wind‑down plan (participants notified, referrals honored, data archived per policy).

If you want, I can turn this into a clean **.docx** and **.pdf** with the templates (A1–A7) stubbed in, plus a one‑page brief for judges and clerks.
