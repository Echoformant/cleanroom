## **Clearlane Latent Authority Trigger Register v1**

**Status:** Draft  
**Applies to:** Operation NAMI Clearlane (Arkansas)  
**Function:** Pre-capture detection · Early warning · Agency preservation  
**Method:** Authority-only · Zero inference · Append-only

---

### **I. Purpose**

The **Latent Authority Trigger Register** enumerates **hidden, indirect, or secondary mechanisms** through which authority may **activate, propagate, or attach** to NAMI Arkansas without explicit intent—particularly through interactions with **Administrative Office of the Courts**, **Arkansas Department of Human Services**, and **Arkansas Department of Health**.

The register exists to surface **activation conditions before they fire**.

---

### **II. How to Read This Register**

Each entry identifies:

* **Trigger** — the mechanism  
* **Source Authority** — where power originates  
* **Activation Condition** — what causes it to attach  
* **Visibility Surface** — where it can be detected  
* **Risk Profile** — low / medium / high  
* **Countermeasure** — required Clearlane action
