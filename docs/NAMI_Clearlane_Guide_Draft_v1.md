# NAMI Clearlane Guide  
## Operational Navigation Framework for VECTOR 1  

**Status:** Draft v1  
**Applies To:** Operation NAMI Clearlane / VECTOR 1  
**Governing Principle:** Law-anchored, evidence-bounded, non-interpretive navigation  
**Audience:** NAMI Arkansas leadership, counsel, board, and designated partners  

---

## I. Guide Purpose and Scope

The **NAMI Clearlane Guide** is an operational navigation document designed to support informed, defensible engagement by NAMI Arkansas within the external legal, institutional, and funding landscape defined as **VECTOR 1**.

The Guide:

- Translates the **Dossier (proof layer)** into usable navigation guidance  
- Operates safely while the Dossier remains incomplete  
- Makes uncertainty explicit rather than implicit  
- Separates authority, implementation, and money at all times  

The Guide **does not**:

- Offer legal opinions  
- Interpret intent or policy motives  
- Recommend funding strategies  
- Substitute for counsel review  

---

## II. Structural Operating Model

All Clearlane analysis and guidance is organized into **three distinct layers**, which are never merged:

### 1. Authority Layer  
Statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and formal policies that establish permission, obligation, or restriction.

### 2. Implementation Layer  
Rules, formulas, advisory committee actions, internal policies, spending plans, and approval processes that operationalize authority.

### 3. Money Layer  
Actual funding flows, appropriations, grants, pass-throughs, restrictions, and conditions.

Every section of this Guide explicitly identifies **which layer(s)** are implicated.

---

## III. How the Guide Handles Incomplete Information

Incomplete research and missing artifacts are expected.

Where implementation or execution artifacts are not yet appended to the Dossier, the Guide:

- Names the governing authority  
- States that implementation artifacts are missing  
- Describes the operational consequence of that absence  
- Identifies the validation path (FOIA, rule search, oversight record)  

**Standard Gap Language:**

> *The governing authority for this area is established; however, implementing regulations, policies, formulas, or advisory rules have not yet been appended to the Dossier. Engagement in this area should be treated as conditional pending validation.*

---

## IV. Clearlane Executive Read-Through (Shell)

The **Executive Read-Through** is a terrain map, not a research summary.

### A. What Is Firm (Validated Authority)

Lists areas where statutory authority, appropriations, and federal requirements are explicit.

### B. What Is Conditional (Authority Present, Implementation Pending)

Identifies areas where execution depends on advisory bodies, formulas, or internal policies not yet appended.

### C. What Is Unverified or Unknown

Identifies areas where authority references implementation mechanisms that are undocumented.

### D. Decision-Safety Framing

Neutral Clearlane status labels:

- **Clearlane-Open**  
- **Clearlane-Conditional**  
- **Clearlane-Unverified**  

---

## V. Advisory and Oversight Bodies

Documents advisory or oversight entities whose actions materially affect outcomes.

Each entry records:

- Statutory basis  
- Scope of authority  
- Binding or conditional nature  
- Known documentation gaps  

---

## VI. Federal Requirements and State Implementation

Distinguishes between:

- Federal obligation  
- State implementation  
- Evidence of compliance  

Missing state implementation artifacts trigger **Clearlane-Conditional** status.

---

## VII. FOIA Appendix (Standing Tool)

### A. Objectives

FOIA is used to surface implementation artifacts, discretion points, and hidden controls.

### B. Target Categories

Requests grouped by implementation domain:

- Advisory committee rules  
- Allocation formulas  
- Internal policies  
- Grant spending plans  
- Match and restriction documentation  

### C. FOIA Template

**Title:** Clearlane Validation Request — [Domain]  

**Target Agency:** [Agency + FOIA contact]  

**Records Requested:**  
All records from [date range] relating to delegations, rules, formulas, advisory actions, and spending plans.

**Search Terms:**  
delegation, redelegation, approval, formula, advisory committee, spending plan, policy, guidance

---

## VIII. Money Flow Interpretation Rules

Appropriation does not imply discretion.

Each flow documents:

- Source  
- Intermediary  
- Destination  
- Restrictions  
- Required approvals  

Undocumented elements trigger **Clearlane-Conditional**.

---

## IX. Guide Evolution

The Guide remains stable while the Dossier evolves.

As artifacts are added:

- Gaps close  
- Conditional sections tighten  
- Status labels update  

---

## X. Practical Next Steps

1. Maintain this Guide as navigation spine  
2. Populate Executive Read-Through incrementally  
3. Run FOIA in parallel with research  
4. Convert gaps into validated artifacts  
5. Update Clearlane labels  

---

## XI. Canonical Framing Statement

> *NAMI Arkansas operates within known authority, explicitly identifies where validation is required, and engages external systems deliberately and defensibly.*
