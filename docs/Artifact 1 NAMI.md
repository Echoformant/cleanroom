Correct. \*\*Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration dollars in Arkansas flow through **Arkansas Department of Human Services**, and that has concrete consequences.

### **What that actually means (no sugar-coating)**

* **Policy gatekeeping:** DHS sets priorities, timing, and allowable uses. If your objective isn’t already aligned, it stalls or dies.  
* **Latency \+ dilution:** Federal intent gets softened by state budget cycles, internal reallocations, and administrative drag.  
* **Noncompetitive reality:** Most SAMHSA funds arrive as **formula/block grants**, not discretionary awards. You don’t “win” them; you wait to be carved into them.  
* **Opacity:** Downstream visibility is poor. Line-item tracing and outcome attribution are weak once DHS redistributes.

### **Practical implications for STRATA / GLE**

* Treat SAMHSA→DHS money as **contextual signal**, not primary fuel.  
* Model it in CLE as **ambient capacity** (constraints \+ ceilings), not as an actionable pipeline.  
* Expect **governance friction**; bake in longer lead times and lower determinism.

### **Cleaner alternatives (if you want leverage)**

* **HRSA discretionary** (workforce, community health) — clearer NOFOs, tighter scope, faster execution.  
* **DOJ/BJA** (crisis, co-responder, diversion) — less DHS mediation.  
* **Foundations \+ hospital systems** — direct contracts, measurable terms.  
* **Corporate/regional philanthropy** — faster decisions, fewer policy detours.

**Bottom line:** SAMHSA funds in Arkansas are real money, but they’re **state-controlled gravity**, not thrust. Use them to understand the field’s shape—not to power the engine.

So listen, this is what we actually want. We are partnered with AOC now. So the money comes through the governor , then to three tracks .. DHS. ADH, and AOC …. We don’t want anything in DHS preferably

Understood. Given that structure, the correct move is to **bypass DHS entirely** and anchor to the other two rails—**AOC** first, **ADH** second.

### **The actual money flow (Arkansas)**

Federal behavioral-health dollars typically enter via the **Governor’s Office**, then fan out to three execution tracks:

1. **Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS)** — slow, policy-heavy, administratively diluted.  
2. **Arkansas Department of Health (ADH)** — programmatic, metrics-driven, cleaner contracts.  
3. **Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC)** — justice-aligned, crisis/intercept focused, lowest entropy.

You already did the hardest part: **partnering with AOC**.

### **What that unlocks (and why it’s the right rail)**

* **Governor → AOC pass-throughs** avoid DHS gatekeeping.  
* Funds framed as **court support, diversion, competency, crisis stabilization, or reentry** sit naturally with AOC.  
* AOC money tolerates **services \+ coordination \+ infrastructure**, not just clinical delivery.  
* Reporting is tighter, timelines shorter, and authority clearer.

### **How to position funding (language matters)**

Frame everything as:

* **Judicial system support**, not “behavioral health services”  
* **Pre-adjudication / diversion / stabilization**  
* **Competency preservation and court efficiency**  
* **Crisis interception before DHS touchpoints**

Avoid:

* Medicaid framing  
* “Treatment expansion”  
* Anything that implies DHS program ownership

### **Secondary rail: ADH (selective use)**

ADH is acceptable **only when**:

* Funds are explicitly public-health scoped (surveillance, education, prevention)  
* There’s no downstream DHS reallocation risk  
* Contracts can be written **direct to partner orgs**, not DHS-administered subgrants

### **Operational directive for STRATA / GLE**

* Tag DHS as **context-only** (constraint awareness, not execution)  
* Treat **AOC as a primary execution node**  
* Model **Governor → AOC** as a first-class funding spine  
* Build proposals and CLE lineage that never require DHS concurrence

### **Bottom line**

You’re right to say “no DHS.”  
**AOC is the cleanest rail in the state.**  
Governor → AOC money is where leverage, speed, and integrity actually exist.

So now I need to know all the money coming through those channels and what federal money does that open up for NAMI. We are looking to fund what we are already doing with the speciality courts.

Thought for 22s

You want two things:

1. **All money that can realistically flow through Governor → AOC and Governor → ADH** (not DHS).  
2. **What federal money those rails unlock for NAMI** to fund/scale what you already do with specialty courts.

What’s knowable immediately (and what to target) is below. Where the exact $ amounts/line items require Arkansas budget/appropriation \+ AOC/ADH award lists, I’m giving you the concrete “pipes” and the specific federal programs that attach to each.

## **AOC rail: money already in the pipe (and adjacent pipes)**

### **AOC specialty courts infrastructure money (federal → AOC)**

* **BJA → AOC**: Arkansas AOC received a **BJA grant** to build a statewide specialty court data system (SCALES). This is proof of direct DOJ/BJA relationship into AOC—no DHS required.

### **Opioid settlement money routed to specialty courts**

* **State opioid settlement funds → specialty courts program**: Arkansas announced **up to $1M** in opioid settlement funding supporting the specialty courts program. This is state-level money, but it’s aligned with the same court outcomes you’re funding.

### **AOC “Accountability Court Fund” style state grant programs**

* Arkansas courts have published specialty-court grant announcements (Accountability Court Fund). Even if the specific round is old, the structure matters: it’s **court-administered grantmaking**, which is the shape you want.

## **ADH rail: money already in the pipe (cleaner than DHS)**

### **988 / suicide prevention federal dollars flowing through ADH (not DHS)**

* Arkansas legislative materials show **ADH administering federal money** for 988 crisis counseling/services via subgrants (example: Western Arkansas Counseling & Guidance Center) with extensions into 2026\. This is a real, current example of “federal → ADH → local provider” flow.

## **What federal money those rails open up for NAMI (specialty courts focus)**

### **Tier 1: Direct-to-court / direct-to-justice grants (best fit with AOC partnership)**

These are the primary federal “unlocks” when you have AOC at the table:

* **DOJ / BJA Adult Treatment Court Program** (the umbrella that includes treatment court funding).  
* **DOJ / BJA Treatment Court Discretionary Grant Program** (assistance listing).  
* **DOJ / BJA Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program (JMHCP)** (explicitly justice \+ mental health collaboration; perfect for NAMI-as-partner).  
* **DOJ / BJA COSSUP** (cross-system substance use response; courts are an eligible system partner; often strong for specialty courts \+ treatment \+ reentry).  
* **DOJ / BJA Second Chance Act programs** (reentry; nonprofit-friendly; slots cleanly under specialty court participant support and continuity of care).

How NAMI fits without being the prime:

* AOC (or a local court) is **prime applicant**.  
* NAMI is **named subrecipient/partner** providing: peer support, family navigation, participant engagement, group programming, housing/benefits navigation, court liaison, warm handoffs, training, and outcomes reporting support.

### **Tier 2: Public-health dollars that can support specialty courts indirectly (ADH rail)**

These funds don’t say “specialty court” on the label, but they fund the services specialty courts need:

* **988 / crisis response** subgrants administered by ADH (model exists now).  
* ADH-administered prevention / injury prevention / suicide prevention streams (often CDC/HHS) that can support court-connected diversion, safety planning, post-crisis follow-up if positioned as public-health harm reduction.

## **What “all the money through those channels” means in practice**

If you’re banning DHS, the money universe breaks into three practical buckets you can enumerate and track in STRATA:

### **A) AOC-administered money (state \+ federal justice grants)**

* DOJ/BJA direct awards to AOC (SCALES is proof).  
* Opioid settlement allocations routed through court structures.  
* Any AOC specialty court grant programs (Accountability Court Fund-style).

### **B) ADH-administered money (federal public-health pass-throughs)**

* 988/suicide prevention and related subgrants administered by ADH.

### **C) Governor-controlled discretionary pools that can be steered to AOC/ADH**

* This varies by year and appropriation, but opioid settlement allocations are a real example of “state-controlled money” supporting specialty courts outside DHS.

## **What to build for NAMI (fund what you already do)**

Your cleanest fundable modules for specialty courts (AOC-friendly language):

* **Court-connected peer support \+ family navigation**  
* **Participant engagement \+ retention**  
* **Training for court teams on mental health, de-escalation, family systems**  
* **Reentry continuity (housing, employment, benefits, community supports)**  
* **Data \+ outcomes support** (tie to AOC’s SCALES direction)

If you want, give me the names of the specific specialty courts you’re already embedded with (e.g., drug court, veterans court, mental health court, HOPE, etc.) and I’ll map each to the best-fit federal programs above with the most defensible “why NAMI” role for each—still keeping DHS out of the execution path.
