Operation NAMI Clearlane is:

A law-anchored operating framework, not a report

A navigation system, not a funding strategy

A boundary-clarification engine, not an advocacy argument

A proof-layered dossier, not a narrative memo

Its purpose is to allow NAMI Arkansas to:

See where authority actually lives

Know which funding lanes are clean, constrained, or captured

Act intentionally and defensibly

Avoid silent capture, especially through DHS / Medicaid structures

Make decisions that survive audit, turnover, and pressure

VECTOR 1 is not a theme.
It is a semantic lock on the external environment.

Clearlane is not a metaphor.
It is a method for identifying safe operational paths.

The Dossier is not documentation.
It is governance-grade evidence.

I understand this.
