  "research_notes": "The batch began with the Accountability Court Fund statute (Ark. Code §19-5-1144), which authorizes creation of a trust fund consisting of grants and other funds to support specialty courts. Turn 1 generated flows representing deposits from grants, the FY2026 appropriation of $400k from the fund to AOC, a $1M opioid settlement grant, and a $2M SAMHSA grant; evidence included the statute and news releases. The legislative audit served as a validation showing misused funds.\nTurn 2 promoted the appropriation flow as anchor and produced authority references for specialty court program evaluation (§16-10-139), the Specialty Court Program Advisory Committee (§10-3-2901), and drug court program authorization (§16-98-303). Evidence came from these statutes and the advisory committee membership list.\nTurn 3 anchored on §16-98-303 and generated flows for federal and state appropriations: $9.19M federal Drug Court Enhancement (Sec.27), $1M federal Juvenile Justice Reform (Sec.29) and $1M cash-funded Adult Drug Court Program (Sec.31). Evidence from Act 776 supported the amounts.\nTurn 4 anchored on the Adult Drug Court Program flow and produced authority references for cost and fees (§16-98-304) and required resources (§16-98-305). Evidence from these statutes described fee schedules, remittances, and resource obligations.\nTurn 5 anchored on §16-98-304 and generated flows for local program user fees, court costs remitted to county funds, and payments to the Department of Community Correction. The cycle stopped because subsequent turns would require new authority references beyond those cited, and additional unique statutes or funding streams could not be located in the available sources."
