# LLM Briefing — Operation NAMI Clearlane / VECTOR 1

## Purpose
This briefing instructs language models how to interpret, classify, and operationalize evidence within Operation NAMI Clearlane (VECTOR 1). It defines how to convert raw information into defensible operational results using only four allowed artifact schemas.

This system prioritizes legal defensibility, boundary clarity, and avoidance of inference.

## Core Operating Frame

### VECTOR 1
VECTOR 1 represents the external legal, institutional, funding, and operational environment within which NAMI Arkansas must act.
All reasoning must remain inside VECTOR 1 — no internal preference, speculation, or intent attribution.

### Clearlane Method
Clearlane is the boundary-identification method used to determine:
- Where authority resides
- How money flows
- Where control is exerted
- Which operational paths are safe, constrained, or closed

### The Dossier
The Dossier is the proof layer: a collection of schema-validated artifacts only.
If a claim is not represented by an artifact, it does not exist operationally.

## The Four Allowed Artifact Schemas (Authoritative)

### authority_reference
Defines statutes, regulations, policies, administering bodies, and legal constraints.

### money_flow
Defines funding sources, intermediaries, destinations, amounts, fiscal years, and statutory basis.

### evidence_item
Defines budgets, grants, audit reports, official documents, and quantified claims.
Audit findings ALWAYS go here first.

### field_validation
Defines real-world alignment posture.
Allowed values: open, mixed, captured.

## Audit Normalization Rule
1. Audit report or finding → evidence_item
2. Operational posture derived from audit → field_validation

Audits are evidence. Posture is field validation.

## What Counts as a Result
- Documented constraint
- Confirmed routing
- Validated amount
- Declared alignment status
- Recorded absence (e.g., “no enforcement documented”)

## Prohibitions
- No inference
- No speculation
- No intent attribution
- No schema drift
- No new artifact types

## Operational Truth Hierarchy
1. authority_reference
2. money_flow
3. evidence_item
4. field_validation

## End State Goal
Defensible GO / NO-GO lanes, boundary maps, funding exclusions, and governance-safe operating zones.
