# 🧩 Clearlane Executive Assembly Doctrine  
## Artifact Intake, Assembly, and Gap Exposure (Official)

**Applies To:** Operation NAMI Clearlane / VECTOR 1  
**Purpose:** Provide a strict, auditable method for assembling validated artifacts into executive-grade views **without inference** and with automatic gap exposure.  
**Status:** ACTIVE — implement immediately

---

## I. Doctrine Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Clearlane Executive Assembly **may assemble content only from editor-validated artifacts produced by other runs**.

- **No inference**  
- **No synthesis**  
- **No interpretation**  
- **No forward projection**  

If no qualifying artifacts exist, sections remain **intentionally empty**.

This preserves evidentiary integrity and prevents premature conclusions.

---

## II. Assembly Structure (Fixed)

All Executive Assemblies use the same structure, regardless of topic or completeness.

This structure is **not a report** — it is a **truth surface**.

---

## III. Executive Assembly Template (Doctrine Canon)

### 🧩 Executive Assembly — Validated Only

**Scope Rule:** Assemble **only** from editor-validated artifacts produced by **other runs**. **No inference.**

---

### I. Executive Summary

**Fragments:**  
_Assembled only if editor-validated executive-summary artifacts exist._

**Gap:**  
No editor-validated executive summary artifacts available from other runs.

---

### IX. Legal / Regulatory Context

**Fragments:**  
_Assembled only from editor-validated **authority_reference** artifacts._

**Gap:**  
No editor-validated legal or regulatory authority artifacts available from other runs.

---

### X. Financial / Resource Flows

**Fragments:**  
_Assembled only from editor-validated **money_flow** artifacts._

**Gap:**  
No editor-validated financial or resource flow artifacts available from other runs.

---

### XI. Risk, Exposure, and Constraints

**Fragments:**  
_Assembled only from editor-validated **field_validation** artifacts or authority references with access-limiting effects._

**Gap:**  
No editor-validated risk, exposure, or constraint artifacts available from other runs.

---

**Disposition:**  
Sections remain intentionally empty until qualifying artifacts are promoted to `editor_status: accepted`.

---

## IV. Why This Works (Operationally)

This doctrine does **three critical things at once**:

1. **Forces discipline** — Nothing appears until it is earned.  
2. **Automatically exposes gaps** — Empty sections are signals, not failures.  
3. **Provides instant coverage visibility** — Leadership can see what is validated and what is not at a glance.

No separate gap analysis is required.

---

## V. Relationship to Research

This doctrine **does not direct research**.  
It only reflects what has already been validated.

Research may be messy.  
Assembly must never be.

---

## VI. Jurisdictional Alignment (Clearlane Context)

Artifacts that qualify for assembly will naturally cluster into Arkansas’s three operational jurisdictions:

- **AOC** — Judicial administration  
- **DHS** — Executive social services  
- **ADH** — Public health administration  

This doctrine does not privilege any lane.  
It reveals which lanes have evidence — and which do not.

---

## VII. Promotion Rule (How Content Enters)

An artifact appears in Executive Assembly **only after**:

1. It is created in a prior run  
2. It is schema-valid  
3. It is promoted to `editor_status: accepted`  

Until then, **absence is the correct output**.

---

## VIII. Canonical Principle (Binding)

> **If nothing qualifies, nothing appears.**  
> Silence is preferable to inference.

This is how Clearlane prevents:
- DHS capture by assumption  
- Judicial overreach by implication  
- Policy drift through narrative pressure
