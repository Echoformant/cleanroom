# START RESEARCHING W SCHEMA 

**What the program *is*:** JMHCP is a Bureau of Justice Assistance initiative that funds collaborative criminal justice \+ mental health strategies to reduce unnecessary justice involvement, enhance public safety, and increase treatment engagement. Funding supports mental health courts and other court‑based programs, cross‑system training, co‑responder or police‑mental health teams, diversion strategies, data‑sharing infrastructure, and intergovernmental collaboration.

**Where the money goes:** Historically, awards have supported:

* Launching or expanding mental health courts and crisis diversion programs

* Training law enforcement and justice partners in crisis response

* Hiring coordinators, peer specialists, and data/evaluation staff

* Crisis intervention and early diversion initiatives

* Inter‑agency planning and data systems to track outcomes and recidivism.

**Award levels & history:** Maximum awards in past cycles (e.g., FY24) approached roughly **$550,000** per recipient, and, since inception, JMHCP has funded hundreds of communities nationwide — with a quarter‑billion dollars in total appropriated historically.

**Application cadence:** As of early **February 2026**, no active **FY2026 JMHCP NOFO** appears on the BJA “Available Funding” list; previous opportunities (FY24 and FY25 versions) are archived, and future solicitations are typically **forecasted** before posting.

**What BJA emphasizes (from past FAQs):** Successful applicants demonstrate true **joint criminal justice \+ behavioral health governance**, robust planning, measurable outcomes, and strong partner support; resources on performance measures, collaboration assessment tools, and mental health court data collection are available to help applicants align with program goals.

For planning purposes, think early about your **joint applicant structure, logic model with concrete outcomes (e.g., treatment engagement, recidivism, crisis call reductions), data/privacy protocols, clear budget mapping to allowable activities, and letters of support**. These foundations position you well for when the next JMHCP NOFO is officially released.
